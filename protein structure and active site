#S-glycoprotein structure and active site identification

[This paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17371-6#data-availability) has identified a crystal structure for the s-glycoprotein.

[This structure](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7A91) has the ACE2 receptor docked with the spike glycoprotein - can we use the S protein structure from this as our protein in the docking, and the ACE2 receptor to identify the docking site?
